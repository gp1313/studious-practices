# studious-practices
My attempts at implementing range of(complexity wise) algorithms and  common linear algebric computations, may be using openCL.

Goal of this repository is to try out implimentation of various image processing algorithms in most appropriate design possible.
My interest in doing so is to get well equipped with concepts of DS, algorithmic analysis, advance cpp concepts that best re-
present code design and later on integrate python for its gui and various databse of libraries.

I will be updating this as I go on with each project, appending information like wise.
